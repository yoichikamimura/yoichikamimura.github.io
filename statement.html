Sound awakens my memory.<br>
<br>
My work explores the relationship between sound and vision, <br>
and through this process I create an experience in which hearing and seeing effect one another.<br>
<br>
Music that I have heard at various points in the past is playing through my iPod.<br>
I listen to this music while rocking back and forth on the train, riding my bicycle, or driving down the highway.<br>
Doing so, the scenery before me at that moment and the scenery that<br>
I saw while listening to the same music at another time in the past become mixed,<br>
and I lose track of where I am.<br>
<br>
I am interested in relationships between sound and scenery such as this, <br>
as well as the various ways people perceive past, present, and future <br>
through the cultural and religious lenses of different areas of the world. <br>
Gathering and rearranging the sounds around us, <br>
I would like to use the act of listening to shake up our perceptions of the scenery and time presently before us.<br>
